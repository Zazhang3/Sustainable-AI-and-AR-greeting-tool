# Project brief
This project is an augmented reality (AR) greeting card Android application. Users can send pre-built messages to areas divided by postcode, and any user in the area can view the sent message. This project uses Sceneform, a 3D framework for the Android platform, to display models produced by Blender. The back-end service of the application, driven by Spring Boot, implements user authentication and data storage and manipulation. The project also integrates AI Watson Text to Speech function. This report begins with background research, then describes the design and implementation process of the project.

# Github branch structure
Separate development of front-end and back-end is the most important feature of our project.\n
The front-end Android application is on [Front_End_Dev](https://github.com/Zazhang3/Sustainable-AI-and-AR-greeting-tool/tree/Front_End_Dev)\n
The Back-end Database is on [Back_End_Dev](https://github.com/Zazhang3/Sustainable-AI-and-AR-greeting-tool/tree/Backend-Dev)\n
The rest of branch is the sub-branch we working on during development. We work on these branch first then send a pull request to ask other teammates to approve the request and merge to above two branchs.
